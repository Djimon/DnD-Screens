      + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving
      throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can''t
      regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
      of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. '
    category: Actions
  - name: Glaive.
    value: ' Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10
      + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a
      construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose 5 (1d10)
      hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each
      time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by
      the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take an action to stanch
      the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes
      if the target receives magical healing.'
