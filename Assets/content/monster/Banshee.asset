    value: " The banshee can magically sense the presence of creatures up to 5 miles

  - name: Horrifying Visage.
    value: " Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the banshee that can see
      her must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
      A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      with disadvantage if the banshee is within line of sight, ending the effect
      on itself on a success. If a target\u2019s saving throw is successful or the
      effect ends for it, the target is immune to the banshee\u2019s Horrifying Visage
      for the next 24 hours."

      sunlight. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead. All other creatures
      within 30 feet of her that can hear her must make a DC 13 Constitution saving
      throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature
      takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage."
