    value: hen the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by
      the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on,
      unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity
      saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one.

    value: "he wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies.
      The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-\xADfoot section has AC 5, 30
      hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic,
      poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet
      of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes
      moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature
      must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates
      when the rest of the wall vanishes."
