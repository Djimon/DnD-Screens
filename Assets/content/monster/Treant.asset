    value: ' The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60
      feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have
      Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can''t speak, and they have only
      the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The
      tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is
      more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action
      to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.'
