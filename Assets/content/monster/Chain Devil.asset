      + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if the devil isn''t

    category: Actions
  - name: other
    value: ach animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance
      to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil
      uses multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one additional
      chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can't
      make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state
      if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.

    value: ' When a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 30 feet of
      the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it looks like one of the
      creature''s departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see
      the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
      until the end of its turn.'
