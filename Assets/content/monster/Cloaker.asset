    value: ' The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if
      it isn''t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions,
      shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the
      real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates
      disappear.'
    category: Actions
  - name: other
    value: henever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell
      while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether
