      throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action
      on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time.

    value: hile charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs
      of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy,
      the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route,
      trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before
      moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes
      damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving
      throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each
      of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
