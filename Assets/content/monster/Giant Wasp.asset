    value: ' Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6
      + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving
      throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
      on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points,
      the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points,
      and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.'
