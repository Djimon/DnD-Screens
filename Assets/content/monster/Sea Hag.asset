      line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature''s saving
      throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the
      hag''s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.'

    value: ' The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with
      a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general
      size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to
      end it or if she dies.'

    value: he changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection.
      For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her
      hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually
      inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check
      to discern that the hag is disguised.
