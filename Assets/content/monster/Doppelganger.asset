    value: ' The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium
      humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than
      its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
      isn''t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies. '

  - name: Read Thoughts.
    value: ' The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature
      within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood
      or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks
      it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its
      thoughts, as long as the doppelganger''s concentration isn''t broken (as if
      concentrating on a spell). While reading the target''s mind, the doppelganger
      has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and
      Persuasion) checks against the target.'
