      guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet''s wearer
      can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian knows
      the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian is within 60 feet
      of the amulet''s wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded up) is
      transferred to the guardian. '

      guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer must
      cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored within
      the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises
      that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell
      with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When
      the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is
      lost.'
