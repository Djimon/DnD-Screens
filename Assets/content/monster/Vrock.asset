    value: " A 15\xAD-foot\xAD-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the
      vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed
      on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in
      this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its
      turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on
      the target also ends the effect on it. "
