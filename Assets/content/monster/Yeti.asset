    value: " The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the
      target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
      throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) cold damage and then be paralyzed
      for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The target can repeat the
      saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
      a success. If the target\u2019s saving throw is successful, or if the effect
      ends on it, the target is immune to the Chilling Gaze of all yetis (but not
      abominable yetis) for 1 hour."
