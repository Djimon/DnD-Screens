    value: ' The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther is doughlike difficult

    value: ' The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn''t
      incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther
      and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On
      a failure, the creature can''t take reactions until the start of its next turn
      and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the
      creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action
      and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a
      7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature
      within its reach or does nothing if it can''t make such an attack.'

      of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature
      within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or
      be blinded until the end of the mouther''s next turn.'
