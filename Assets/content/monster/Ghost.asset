      target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
      the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw
      is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's
      Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with
      a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring."

      The ghost now controls the body but doesn''t deprive the target of awareness.
      The ghost can''t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except
      ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom,
      Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the
      possessed target''s statistics, but doesn''t gain access to the target''s knowledge,
      class features, or proficiencies.'

      in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this
      ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after
      the possession ends.
