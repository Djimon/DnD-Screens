    value: " A 10\xAD-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch.
      The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts
      for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts
      its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or
      be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the
      target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and
      can't take reactions."
