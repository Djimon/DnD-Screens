    value: " The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or it can\u2019t
      take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can\u2019t
      move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly
      determined creature within range. If the target can\u2019t attack, it does
      nothing on its turn.\r\nParalyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13
      Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat
      the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
      on a success.\r\nFear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving
      throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw
      at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible
      to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.\r\nWounding Ray. The
      target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic
      damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\_"

    value: ' If the spectator makes a successful saving throw against a spell, or
      a spell attack misses it, the spectator can choose another creature (including
      the spellcaster) it can see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen
      creature instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, the
      chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack
      roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.'
