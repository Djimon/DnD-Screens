  - name: Deadly Leap.
    value: ' If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can
      then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more
      other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or
      Dexterity saving throw (target''s choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6
      + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful
      save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn''t knocked prone, and is
      pushed 5 feet out of the bulette''s space into an unoccupied space of the creature''s
      choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls
      prone in the bulette''s space.'
