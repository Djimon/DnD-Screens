    value: ' When a creature that can see the medusa''s eyes starts its turn within
      30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution
      saving throw if the medusa isn''t incapacitated and can see the creature. If
      the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise,
      a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The
      restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn,
      becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification
      lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other
      magic.'

      creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the
