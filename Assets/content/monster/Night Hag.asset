  - name: Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).
    value: ' While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid
      on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target
      prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists,
      the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour,
      the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced
      by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target''s hit point maximum to 0, the
      target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag''s
      soul bag. The reduction to the target''s hit point maximum lasts until removed
      by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.'
